_**Assignment 2 Instructions CS303: Data Structures UMKC Summer 2024**_

This is a C++ program that implements the uses of stacks using vectors, coinciding with the uses of the stack and single linked list class that I have created for this program. It displays a menu to the user interacting with this program. The menu consist of exactly 7 options. Each options is a specific thing the user wishes to perform on this program. After a prompt for the user to enters whatever letter they wish, the options and what they do will go according to the following:

**Option A:** Will simply print a message depending on the current status of the stacks. If the user picks this option first, the message will appear as follows:

If the user selects option A after a few actions later. The message will appear as:

**Option B:** This option will prompt the user of entering their integer value to push into the stack. Then, it will print a confirmation message back to the user.

**Option C:** This option will prompt the user to enter an index of an element to remove from the stack. Afterwards, it will print a message of confirmation that the action has been done. Otherwise, it will send an error saying the index is "out of range".

**Option D:** This option will simply return back to the user what element is exactly at the top of the stack.

**Option E:** This option will calculate and return the average of the all the elements that user has put into the stack. If the stack is empty, it will simply return with a message of "Stack is empty".

**Option F:** This option simply does displays how the stack looks like at the exact moment.

**Option Q:** The very last option in the menu will simply print messages of exiting out of the program and display a goodbye message to the user.
